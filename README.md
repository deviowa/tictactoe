# tictactoe
A Tic Tac Toe Game created with Javascript.

## How to get it:
download here[https://github.com/deviowa/tictactoe/archive/master.zip] 

or clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/deviowa/tictactoe.git
  
  
## How to run it
Everything is implemented browser side, so you just need a way to serve thr static files.  Any webserver should do. If you have python installed (default on OSX and must unix based systems), you can just do `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to start a simple static webserver that serves the files in the working directory.

so to summarize, open a terminal and enter the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/deviowa/tictactoe.git
cd tictactoe
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

then open your browser and enter localhost:8000 in the URL field to load http://localhost:8000 and play tic tac toe.
